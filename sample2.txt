After decades of neglect, Liverpool's north docks 
now seem to be the place where it's all happening.

It's home to the culturally led Ten Streets 
project consisting of music venues and creative startups. There's 
luxury apartments in Stanley Dock 
Tobacco Warehouse, with a luxury hotel next door - The Titanic.

Highrise flats and offices have nudged 
their way into the city skyline at Princes Dock. Further 
along the dock road, a new neighbour in the area is settling in at 
Bramley Moore, with Everton's new stadium edging closer to completion 
by the day.
